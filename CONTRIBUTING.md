# Contributing to MySocial Improvement Proposals

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the MySocial ecosystem. This document outlines the process for submitting and reviewing MySocial Improvement Proposals (MyIPs).

## The MyIP Process

The MyIP process is designed to provide an open forum for the community to collaborate on improvements to the MySocial protocol. The process follows these stages:

1. **Idea**: An idea for a proposal is discussed in the community
2. **Draft**: A formal proposal is written and submitted as a pull request
3. **Review**: The community reviews and provides feedback on the proposal
4. **Last Call**: The proposal enters a final review period before being accepted
5. **Accepted/Final**: The proposal is accepted and implemented, or finalized if implementation is complete
6. **Withdrawn/Stagnant**: The proposal is withdrawn by the author or becomes inactive

## How to Submit a MyIP

### 1. Check Existing Proposals

Before drafting a new MyIP, search existing proposals to ensure your idea hasn't already been proposed.

### 2. Discuss Your Idea

Start by discussing your idea with the community. This can help refine the concept and gather initial feedback.

### 3. Fork This Repository

Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.

### 4. Create Your MyIP

Create a new file in the `MyIPs` directory using the [MyIP template](./MyIPs/myip-template.md). Follow these naming conventions:
- Draft proposals: `myip-draft-title.md`
- Once assigned a number: `myip-N-title.md` (where N is the MyIP number)

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

Submit a pull request to the main repository. In your PR description:
- Briefly describe the purpose of your MyIP
- Link to any relevant discussions or issues
- Highlight any areas where you'd like specific feedback

### 6. Review Process

The MyIP will be reviewed by the community and the MySocial team. Be prepared to:
- Respond to feedback and questions
- Make revisions as needed
- Engage in discussions about technical details

### 7. Implementation

If your MyIP is accepted, work with the community to implement it. The implementation may involve:
- Code changes to MySocial clients
- Updates to the MySocial protocol
- Documentation updates

## Style Guide

When writing your MyIP:
- Use clear, concise language
- Define technical terms and acronyms
- Include diagrams where helpful
- Follow Markdown formatting best practices
- Include comprehensive rationale for design decisions
- Address potential security considerations

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) during the MyIP process.
