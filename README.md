## MyIP Status
- **Draft**: A MyIP that is open for consideration
- **Last Call**: A MyIP that is scheduled for formal review
- **Accepted**: A MyIP that has been accepted for implementation
- **Final**: A MyIP that has been adopted by the MySocial ecosystem
- **Stagnant**: A MyIP that has had no activity for at least 3 months
- **Withdrawn**: A MyIP that has been withdrawn by the author(s) or rejected
