## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the issue being addressed.

## Motivation
Why is this change necessary? What problem does it solve? What are the benefits of implementing this proposal?

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current MySocial platforms.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work.

## Backwards Compatibility
All MyIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The MyIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.

## Test Cases
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for MyIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other MyIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

## Implementation
The implementations must be completed before any MyIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the MyIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.

## Security Considerations
All MyIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed.
