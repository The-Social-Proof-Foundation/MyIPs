## Creating a new MyIP

When creating a new MyIP, use the [MyIP template](./myip-template.md) as a starting point.

MyIPs should follow a consistent naming convention:
- Draft and Proposed MyIPs: `myip-draft-title.md`
- Accepted and Final MyIPs: `myip-N-title.md` (where N is the MyIP number)

For questions about the MyIP process, please open an issue or contact the MySocial team.
